netsh interface ipv4 show excludedportrange protocol=tcp

Check port exclusion ranges whether your port falls under this list; if yes then use the following commands:

net stop winnat
net start winnat

After Windows 10 Update KB4074588, some ports are reserved by Windows and applications cannot bind to these ports. 50067 is in the blocked range.

You can use

netsh interface ipv4 show excludedportrange protocol=tcp

to list the reserved ranges.
