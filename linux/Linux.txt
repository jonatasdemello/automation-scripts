Linux
Adding User to the sudo Group
usermod -aG sudo username
sudo whoami

To do that, open the /etc/sudoers file:

visudo

Scroll down to the end of the file and add the following line: /etc/sudoers

username  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL

nstead of editing the sudoers file, you can accomplish the same by
creating a new file with the authorization rules in the /etc/sudoers.d directory.
Add the same rule as you would add to the sudoers file:

echo "username  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/username


sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install <package>


sudo lspci -v


Uninstall the bcmwl-kernel-source package by issuing the following command on a terminal:
sudo apt-get purge bcmwl-kernel-source

Make sure that the firmware-b43-installer and the b43-fwcutter packages are installed (of course you will need internet by others means):
sudo apt-get install firmware-b43-installer b43-fwcutter
