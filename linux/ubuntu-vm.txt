In case other people encounter the same issue.

I do not understand why things a re happening, but I found a workaround.

When the display freezes

    I press Ctrl-Alt-F1 (switch from the X-display to a text console)
    I login as the same user as for my X session
    I use ps to identify a process xfce4-screenssaver
    I kill this process
    I press alt-F7 to go back to my x-windows screen

Now everything is unlocked again:

Why all this is happening (especially as I explicitly disabled the screensaver in settings) is beyond my comprehension


As mentioned by @gelonida, this issue is likely related to screensaver. For a VM, its a waste to have screensaver enabled so its probably best to uninstall it and block it from being re-installed automatically.

Uninstall:

sudo apt remove xfce4-screensaver

Block from being re-installed by creating /etc/apt/preferences.d/noscreensaver.pref as su with contents:

# This is to prevent screensaver from ever being installed
Package: xfce4-screensaver
Pin: release a=*
Pin-Priority: -10
