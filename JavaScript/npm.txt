Configuring Python Dependency

node-gyp requires that you have installed a compatible version of Python,

one of: v3.6, v3.7, v3.8, or v3.9.

If you have multiple Python versions installed, you can identify which Python version node-gyp
should use in one of the following ways:


1) by setting the --python command-line option, e.g.:

node-gyp <command> --python /path/to/executable/python

2)  If node-gyp is called by way of npm, and you have multiple versions of Python installed,
	then you can set npms python config key to the appropriate value:

npm config set python /path/to/executable/python

3) If the PYTHON environment variable is set to the path of a Python executable,
	then that version will be used, if it is a compatible version.

4) If the NODE_GYP_FORCE_PYTHON environment variable is set to the path of a Python executable,
	it will be used instead of any of the other configured or builtin Python search paths.
	If its not a compatible version, no further searching will be done.

	However, please note that this will install the pure JavaScript implementation of Sass,
	which runs somewhat slower than the other options listed here.
	But it has the same interface, so itâ€™ll be easy to swap in another implementation later if you need a bit more speed!

	If you use the Chocolatey package manager for Windows, you can install Dart Sass by running



Found bindings for the following environments:
- OS X 64-bit with Node.js 4.x

This usually happens because your environment has changed since running `npm install`.

Run `npm rebuild node-sass` to build the binding for your current environment.

npm rebuild node-sass

This can occur when you have compiled modules locally and checked the resulting node_modules folder into git before deploying.
To fix this, we recommend removing the node_modules folder from your git repo and redeploying.
