Failed to register URL "http://localhost:9608/" for site "CMS" application "/". Error description: Access is denied. (0x80070005)

cannot start the website because administrative privileges are required to bind the hostname or port

netsh http show urlacl

which showed me

Reserved URL            : http://*:15888/
        User: \Everyone
            Listen: Yes
            Delegate: No
            SDDL: D:(A;;GX;;;WD)

So for my case, I have removed it from this list and it worked again. Here is the command for removing:

netsh http delete urlacl http://*:15888/


netsh http delete urlacl http://*:3387/
netsh http delete urlacl http://+:3387/rdp/
netsh http delete urlacl https://+:3392/rdp/

That will list the process bindings for each queue / port / namespace.
NETSH HTTP SH SER
