Turns out that I sent a quick Tweet out over Twitter and several people responded with the short cut to move a window inside of the VS environment:

Alt – M  (that’s Alt minus M)

which lets you move a window with the keyboard by using the arrow keys. The process for the Find Dialog is to press Ctrl-F to activate the window then Alt – M followed by moving the arrow keys until you find the window in your work space.
