    The Reg.exe utility from the Microsoft Windows NT Resource Kit must be installed on your computer.

    To change the startup value for a service on a local computer by using the command line, type the following at the command prompt and then press ENTER: REG UPDATE HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\servicename\Start=X where servicename is the name of the service as it appears in the registry and X is either a 2, a 3, or a 4 (representing automatic startup, manual startup, or disabled, respectively).

    To change the startup value for a service on a remote computer by using the command line locally, type the following at the command prompt and press ENTER: REG UPDATE HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\servicename\Start=X \servername where servicename is the name of the service as it appears in the registry, X is either a 2, a 3, or a 4 (representing automatic startup, manual startup, or disabled, respectively), and servername is the name of the remote server.

    To see how the service name appears in the registry, view the following registry key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\


reg add "HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\cbdhsvc" /v "Start" /t REG_DWORD /d "4" /f


    Start the registry editor (regedit.exe)
    Move to the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services key
    Select the key of the service you want to delete
    From the Edit menu select Delete
    You will be prompted "Are you sure you want to delete this Key" click Yes
    Exit the registry editor

instsrv <service name> remove

Alternatively, also with the resource kit is a utility SRVINSTW.EXE that again installs and removes services, but with a GUI wizard format allowing you to select the service either locally or remotely.
