sc query state= all to find a complete list.
If the computer in question is remote, you should use
sc \\computername query state= all.

sc qc service_name. To stop a particular service from running on a computer,
use sc \\computername stop service_name.
And if you have to start a service on a computer,
you can use sc \\computername start service_name.

Another query command that can come in handy if,
for example, you have to see the results of a security audit is auditpol /get /category:*.
With this command, you can ask for and establish audit settings on a local computer.
To see the same results in CSV format you can use auditpol /get /category:* /r.

sc query type= service > "%userprofile%\Desktop\ServicesList.txt"

Get-Service | Where Status -eq "Running" | Out-GridView


For instance, you can use the Get-Service cmdlet, filter the status on the word Running, and then output to the GridView, by using the following command:

Get-Service | Where Status -eq "Running" | Out-GridView

This will generate a list of the Running Services, and another window will open to show the result.

To retrieve information about Stopped Services on a remote computer, and output it to GridView, use -ComputerName parameter, as shown below:

Get-Service -ComputerName RemoteComputerName | Where Status -eq "Stopped" | Out-GridView

To export the list of Windows Services, use the following command:

Get-Service | Where-Object {$_.Status -eq "Running"} | Out-File -filepath "$Env:userprofile\Desktop\ServicesList.txt"

This will save the list as a text file on your Desktop.
