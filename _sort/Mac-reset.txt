SMC

For MacBooks, the process is as follow:

    Shut down the computer.
    On the left side of the keyboard, press and hold the Shift, Control, and Option keys while simultaneously holding the power button.
    After 10 seconds, release all of the keys.
    Turn on your MacBook.

For a desktop, follow these instructions:

    Shut down the computer.
    Unplug the power cord.
    Plug the cord back in after 15 seconds have passed.
    Wait at least 5 seconds and then turn on your Mac.

If these steps fail to resolve the issue, repeat them one more time.
PRAM

The process for resetting the PRAM is the same across all devices. To start:

    Shut down the computer.
    Press the power button.
    Immediately after, press Command, Option, P, and R all at the same time on the keyboard.
    Hold these keys down until you hear the Mac's startup sound for a second time (the first was after the initial press of the power button).
    Release all of the keys.

As previously mentioned, repeating the steps may work if your issue isn't resolved.
