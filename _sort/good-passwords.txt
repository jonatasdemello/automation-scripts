For example if you choose the phrase "My daughter was born at Sheffield hospital in 1984",
then by taking the first letter of each word you’ll end up with a password that's both strong and easy to remember ("Mdwb@Shi1984") .

P!Tdh2bd2r

Mi40mwoL^tP

05wtyIbmfh!
From:   05 was the year I bought my first house!
