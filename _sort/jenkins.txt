I had the same problem. It appeared that the java runtime enviromment had been updated.
In the jenkins installation folder there is as jenkins.wrapper.log.
This contains logging from the jenkins.exe service wrapper.
In my case it tried to start java from c:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_144\bin.
This folder did not exist, instead, java was installed in c:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_161\bin.

In the jenkins installation folder there is also a jenkins.xml.

This contains the reference to the java installation in the tag.
Change it to your current java installation and it will start again.



I also had this problem after each java update. But there is a version-independent absolute path, that can be used to start the java run-time: C:\ProgramData\Oracle\Java\javapath\java.exe.

I changed jenkins-slave.xml to use this path:

<executable>C:\ProgramData\Oracle\Java\javapath\java.exe</executable>

you can recliam disk space in your windows \ winsxs directory ( instructions can be found with the listed blog link)
www.sqlskills.com/blogs/glenn/how-to-reclaim-disk-space-in-your-windowswinsxs-directory-on-windows-server-2008-r2-sp1/

You can also verify which folders and files utilize the most space using the Sysinternals Disk Usage tool,
simply run the command

	du /v /u c:>File_Usage.txt

this command will show a list of files and size and write it to a file.
One thing you’ll notice is that the windows\winsxs folder will be large to say the least.
﻿
Find the Dism.exe tool in the windows\system32 directory.
Run the command
	dism.exe /online /cleanup-Image /spsuperseded

	DISM.exe /online /Cleanup-Image /spsuperseded

This will remove files that are residual of previous service pack installations and you will not be able to uninstall the SP1.
If you have any concerns be sure to read up on the tool.
You can utilize the help option “dism /online /Cleanup-Image /?” to check out any of the functions.
 Below is an example of running the command (just happens to be a Win7 build, its the same on Server 2008).
﻿Delete the blobs.bin file and reboot.
The blobs.bin file are located in the windows\winsxs\ManifestCache directory, the file is a caching file and recreated on reboot.
C:\Windows\system32>dism.exe /online /cleanup-Image /spsuperseded
