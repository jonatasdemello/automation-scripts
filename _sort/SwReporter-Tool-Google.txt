Go to the directory: [Drive]:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\SwReporter\
Replace [Drive] and [Username] with your hard drive letter and user account name, respectively.
Select the folder(s) present on the screen, right click on them, and select "Properties". The properties window should open.
Go to the "Security" tab and click on "Advanced". A new window should open.
Click on "Disable Inheritance". A new window should open. Select "Remove all inherited permissions from this object."
Click "Ok" or "Apply". Access to the software reporting tool folder(s) should be disabled now, so they won't run.
You should periodically check this folder, as Google will release new versions of the software reporting tool, and you will need to disable them using the above procedure.
