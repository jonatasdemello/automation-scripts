Method 1 — Simple and mostly reliable

    -has:userlabels -in:sent -in:chat -in:draft -in:inbox

Method 2 — Simple but doesn’t work for everyone

    has:nouserlabels -in:sent -in:chat -in:draft -in:inbox

Method 3 — Highly reliable but a pain in the butt

    -label:{label1 label2} -label:label-three -label:label-four -in:sent -in:chat -in:inbox

Method 4 — Roundabout but very effective

    Search for everything with any label (has:userlabels),
	apply a new label to all messages found, LABEL
	then search for messages with no labels.
	This can help with some of the issues related to Conversation Mode.

	First search for every message that HAS a label (has:userlabels)
    Label ALL of the results with a new “LABELED” label (or whatever you want)
    Now search for has:nouserlabels
    Ba Dum, you got them!
    Delete your “LABELED” label.
