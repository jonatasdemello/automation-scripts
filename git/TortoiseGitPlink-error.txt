TortoiseGitPlink Fatal Error

No supported authentication methods available (server sent: publickey)

For me there was a problem to perform actions against the remote repository only when using TortoiseGit, through CMD / GitBash there have been no issue at all.

So what I did was Very simple:
I opened TortoiseGit-->Settings --> Network and in SSH Client I changed to
"C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\ssh.exe" instead of "TortoiseGitPlink.exe".

For TortoiseGit Users on Windows
(as I originally posted in this question)

I used to setup most of my Github/Bitbucket repositories using the SSH repository URLs as (originally) it used to be the only convenient way to prevent TortoiseGit from prompting for your password on every single action.

But setting TortoiseGit up this way was always hair-pullingly painful. Every time it took me hours to set up correctly, as the default installation options never seemed to work (even as of 2016, sheesh!).

But TortoiseGit now has better password management for HTTPS, and Github actually recommends using HTTPS URLs wherever possible.

    SSH URL: git@github.com:User/repo-name.git

    HTTPS URL: https://github.com/User/repo-name.git

The benefits of HTTPS are:

    No managing or generating of SSH keys
    No need to have pageant.exe constantly running (which requests your password on each launch)
    Using TortoiseGit from Australia, I find that clones over HTTPS are 5-10x faster than SSH
