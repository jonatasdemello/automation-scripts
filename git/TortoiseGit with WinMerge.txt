TortoiseGit with WinMerge

https://www.bricelam.net/2014/08/14/using-winmerge-with-tortoisegit.html

Under Configure the program used for comparing different revisions of files, select External and type the following into the box.

WinMergeU /r /e /x /u /wl %base %mine

Next, select Merge Tool (on the left). Again, select External and type the following.

WinMergeU /e /u %merged


It's interesting use parameters "/dl %bname /dr %yname" to setup left and right window titles, respectively:

WinMergeU /r /e /x /u /wl /dl %bname /dr %yname %base %mine

/wl (left panel is read-only) parameter can be an issue If you love to "review" the modifications (by merging the right panel with the left one).
I prefer this setup (without /wl, with /fr (focus on right panel)):

WinMergeU /r /e /x /u /fr %base %mine
