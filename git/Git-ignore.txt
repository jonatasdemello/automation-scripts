To untrack a single file that has already been added/initialized to your repository, i.e., 

stop tracking the file but not delete it from your system use: 

	git rm --cached filename

To untrack every file that is now in your .gitignore:
First commit any outstanding code changes, and then, run this command:

	git rm -r --cached .

This removes any changed files from the index(staging area), then just run:

	git add .

Commit it:

	git commit -m ".gitignore is now working"

To undo git rm --cached filename, use git add filename.



git rm -r --cached .
git add .
git commit -m ".gitignore is now working"
