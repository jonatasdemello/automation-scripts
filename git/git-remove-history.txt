Tell your collaborators to rebase, not merge, any branches they created off of your old (tainted) repository history.
One merge commit could reintroduce some or all of the tainted history that you just went to the trouble of purging.


or you can use another way to rebase a branch.

switch to master
	git checkout master
    git pull origin master
switch back to your own branch
	git checkout {your branch}
    git rebase origin/master

then, your branch is updated to newest commits.


git rebase <upstream> <branch>

is equal to

git checkout <branch>
git rebase <upstream>
