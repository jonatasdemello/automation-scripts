Setting your branch to exactly match the remote branch can be done in two steps:

git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/master

Update @2020 (if you have main branch instead of master in remote repo)

git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main

If you want to save your current branch's state before doing this (just in case), you can do:

git commit -a -m "Saving my work, just in case"
git branch my-saved-work
