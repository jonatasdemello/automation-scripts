$ git checkout --track origin/newsletter

git branch -vv

Branch 'K5-3241' set up to track remote branch 'K5-3241' from 'origin'.
Switched to a new branch 'K5-3241'


First, fetch the remote branches:

 git fetch origin

Next, checkout the branch you want. In this case, the branch we want is called “branchxyz.”

 git checkout -b branchxyz origin/branchxyz

Or you can use:

 git branch branchxyz origin/branchxyz

With newer versions, you can simply use:

 git fetch

 git checkout branchxyz
