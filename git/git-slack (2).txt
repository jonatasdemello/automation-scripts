https://github.com/integrations/slack#configuration



@here, Hi everyone!
I would like to kindly ask people to refrain from installing Slack apps that integrate with Github.
The reason for that is because we are in a specific plan, which only allows 5000 github apis calls per hour.
We had an issue some time ago where our PR's were being blocked or having to wait a long time to merge it in Jenkins.
(Jenkins and Jira are already hooked to Github, and they are in my opinion of high importance...)
Plus, there is a security concern here, giving access to our code to someone else.

But fear not, we already have this one installed:

https://slack.github.com/
https://github.com/integrations/slack

Thank you!


Subscribing and Unsubscribing

At this point, your Slack and GitHub user accounts are not linked. To link the two accounts, authenticate to GitHub using a /github slash command, /github signin.

The /github slash command also accepts a subscribe argument that you can use to subscribe to an Organization or Repository's activity /github subscribe <organization>/<repository>.

If you originally gave the app access to "All repositories" and you've created a new private repository on GitHub after installing the GitHub integration for Slack, the /github subscribe command will work automatically on your new repository. If you installed the app on a subset of repositories, the app will prompt you to install it on the new repository.

The /github slash command also supports unsubscribe. To unsubscribe to notifications from a repository, use /github unsubscribe <organization>/<repository>

/github subscribe owner/repo [feature]
/github unsubscribe owner/repo [feature]

These are enabled by default, and can be disabled with the /github unsubscribe owner/repo [feature] command:

    issues - Opened or closed issues
    pulls - New or merged pull requests, as well as draft pull requests marked "Ready for Review"
    statuses - Statuses on pull requests
    commits - New commits on the default branch (usually master)
    deployments - Updated status on deployments
    public - A repository switching from private to public
    releases - Published releases

These are disabled by default, and can be enabled with the /github subscribe owner/repo [feature] command:

    reviews - Pull request reviews
    comments - New comments on issues and pull requests
    branches - Created or deleted branches
    commits:all - All commits pushed to any branch
    +label:"your label" - Filter issues, pull-requests and comments based on their labels.

You can subscribe or unsubscribe from multiple settings at once.
For example, to turn on activity for pull request reviews and comments:

/github subscribe owner/repo reviews comments

And to turn it back off:

/github unsubscribe owner/repo reviews comments
