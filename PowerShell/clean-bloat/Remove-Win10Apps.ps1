.SYNOPSIS
    Removes installed and provisioned Appx packages in Windows 10.
.DESCRIPTION
    To simplify the user experience and to streamline the configuration of Windows this script removes unneccesary Windows 10 apps.  These have been sorted into 4 categories:

    Home = Computers used in a home setting.  The difference between this and the ones below is this keeps the Xbox apps, and Mail app as they make sense on a personal computer.
    Named = Computers that are normally used by a single person in a typical office environment. Or at least typical where I work.
    Shared = Computers that are normally shared by multiple people with shared logins and have more direct functions (Lab PC, HR Kiosk, Conference Room PC etc.)
    Server = Computers that are used in a server type function, running Windows 10, and not used as a desktop PC. (Manufacturing floor PC, badge printing system etc.)

    Note that these lists are cumulative.
    Home = Home list
    Named = Home + Named lists
    Shared = Home + Named + Shared lists
    Server = Named + Shared + Server lists

    Suggest putting this in a computer based GPO login script
.EXAMPLE
    PS C:\>.\Remove-Win10Apps.ps1
    Removes all apps from the default home list asking for confirmation for each found app. Writes log to 'C:\Logs\Remove-Win10Apps.log'.
.EXAMPLE
    PS C:\>.\Remove-Win10Apps.ps1 -LogPath '\\server\share\appremoval.log'
    Removes all apps from the default home list asking for confirmation for each found app. Writes log to '\\server\share\appremoval.log'.
.EXAMPLE
    PS C:\>.\Remove-Win10Apps.ps1 -PCType "Shared" -Whatif
    Won't remove but just list all apps from the combined default home, named, and then shared list that it's found.
.EXAMPLE
    PS C:\>.\Remove-Win10Apps.ps1 -PCType "Server" -Confirm:$false
    Removes all apps from the default home, named, shared, and server list without prompting for confirmation. Writes log to 'C:\Logs\Remove-Win10Apps.log'.
