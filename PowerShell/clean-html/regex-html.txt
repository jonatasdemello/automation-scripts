Code: Remove Duplicate Syntax Highlighting Language Attributes
What This Does

Some export routines add duplicate language attributes to code blocks. This replaces the two attributes with a single new attribute that I prefer.
Regex

    class='language-([^']+)'\s+lang='\1'>

    Replace with:
    class="lang-\1">

Example

Replace Paragraph Tags with Newlines
What This Does

WordPress doesn’t require authors to enclose paragraphs in <p> </p> tags. Instead, it adds those automatically to the HTML when it identifies a paragraph.

To optimize readability in the backend, I remove HTML paragraph tags that are added by many tools’ export routines.
Regex

    Search for:
    </?p>

    Replace with:
    \n

Example

    Before:
    <p>Text in a paragraph.</p>

    After:
    \nText in a paragraph.\n

Replace HTML-Encoded Special Characters With Plain Text
What This Does

Many tools’ export routines replace special characters with their corresponding HTML entities, aka they HTML-encode such special characters. With WordPress, this type of encoding is not necessary, as WordPress does it automatically. To optimize readability in the backend, I convert HTML entities back to plain text.

The regex presented below uses a syntax that is available in Notepad++ (regex docs) and all other applications that use the boost regex library. The regex makes the following replacements:

    &lt; → <
    &gt; → >
    &#39; → '
    &quot; → "
    &amp; → &

Regex

    Search for:
    (&lt;)|(&gt;)|(&#39;)|(&quot;)|(&amp;)

    Replace with:
    (?1<)(?2>)(?3')(?4")(?5&)

Example

    Before:
    &lt;a href=&#39;([^']+)&#39;&gt;

    After:
    <a href='([^']+)'>
