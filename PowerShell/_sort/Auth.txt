Authentication is the process of a user/subject proving its ownership of a presented identity, by providing a password or some other uniquely owned or presented factor.
Authorization is the process of letting a subject access resources after a successful authentication, oftentimes somewhere else.
Many people think that OAuth stands for open authentication, but itâ€™s more helpful to understand it by thinking about it as open AUTHorization.
