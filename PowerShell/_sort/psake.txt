How to get started

Step 1: Download and extract the project

You will need to "unblock" the zip file before extracting - PowerShell by default does not run files downloaded from the Internet. Just right-click the zip and click on "properties" and click on the "unblock" button.

Step 2: CD into the directory where you extracted the project (where the psake.psm1 file is)

    Import-Module .\psake.psm1

If you encounter the following error "Import-Module : ...psake.psm1 cannot be loaded because the execution of scripts is disabled on this system." Please see "get-help about_signing" for more details.

    Run PowerShell as administrator
    Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

    Get-Help Invoke-psake -Full

        this will show you help and examples of how to use psake

Step 3: Run some examples

    CD .\examples

    Invoke-psake

        This will execute the "default" task in the "psakefile.ps1"

    Invoke-psake .\psakefile.ps1 Clean

        will execute the single task in the psakefile.ps1 script

Step 4: Set your PATH variable

If you wish to use the psake command from outside of the install folder, add the folder install directory to your PATH variable.

Step 5: (With VS2017) Install the VSSetup dependency

psake uses VSSetup to locate msbuild when using Visual Studio 2017. The VSSetup PowerShell module must be installed prior to compiling a VS2017 project with psake. Install instructions for VSSetup can be found here and here.
